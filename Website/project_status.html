        <h2>Status Update - Week of 11/20</h2>
        <strong>Problems</strong>
        <l>
          <li>During the launch, there was a leak somewhere that caused the helium to vent during the flight
            <ul>
              <li>This limited the maximum altitude to ~15000 ft</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </l>
        <strong>Current Status</strong>
        <l>
          <li>The launch gave us some valuable information on what worked with the design and where there were problems
            <ul>
              <li>Specifically, we learned that our communication and ballast release was working as intended</li>
              <li>We also learned that the design is capable of venting helium, but it may not be capable of preventing helium venting</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </l>
        <strong>Task Status</strong>
        <l>
          <li>The team successfully launched the balloon
            <ul>
              <li>Communication and ballast release were demonstrated during the flight</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </l>
        <strong>Planned Tasks</strong>
        <l>
          <li>The group will work together to finalize the poster before the November 26 soft deadline</li>
          <li>The group will also aim to have a slide deck generated to send to Navid by the beginning of next week
            <ul>
              <li>Some of this information will be used to write the final report</li>

        <h2>Status Update - Week of 11/13</h2>
        <strong>Problems</strong>
        <l>
          <li>Rain is interfering with testing</li>
          <li>IMU and Temperature sensors were removed from the design due to difficulties communicating and incorrect data respectively
            <ul>
              <li>Temperature is now being calculated on the pressure sensors</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </l>
        <strong>Current Status</strong>
        <l>
          <li>Most of the code has been tested and is working as anticipated</li>
          <li>Enclosure has been redesigned to fit within weight limits - maximize ballast capacity</li>
          <li>Communication with the IMU has not been solved. It is thought to be an issue with the TxRx ports as communication via USB works. This connection is not feasible for the launch though. Kyle has run the simulations, and taking the IMU out of the design will not have a significant impact on the control algorithm.</li>
        </l>
        <strong>Task Status</strong>
        <l>
          <li>The group tested most systems this past weekend. Pressure sensors, GPS, and temperature measurements seem to be working. Control of the servos for helium and ballast release is working. The cut-down method and code is working at ground temperature and conditions.</li>
          <li>Communications code was fixed for sending messages from the payload to the ground station.</li>
        </l>
        <strong>Planned Tasks</strong>
        <l>
          <li>Test sending messages from ground station to payload</li>
          <li>Test altitude change measurement (start from ground, move to roof of building and check altitude)</li>
          <li>Full dry run of control code (try to release ballast and "vent" helium with altitude change)</li>
          <li>Dry run of setup for launch</li>
        </l>

        <h2>Status Update - Week of 11/6</h2>
        <strong>Problems</strong>
        <l>
          <li>IMU is currently unable to communicate with the main arduino

            </ul>
          </li>
        </l>
        <strong>Current Status</strong>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The physical payload is nearly complete

          <li>The group has scheduled a meeting with Dr. Cohen tomorrow (11/6)</li>
          <li>Brandon and Mathew have made progress in completing the HW assembly</li>
          <li>Kristy and David R. implemented the IMU communication method
            <ul>
              <li>It is working on both components individually, but the connection is not working properly</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </l>
        <strong>Planned Tasks</strong>
