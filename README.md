## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an altitude and location control system 
for a latex HAB to allow long duration flights over a general location. 
Algorithms take into account current pressure and temperature conditions when 
venting helium or dropping ballast to estimate altitude changes. This will
allow for inexpensive controlled balloon flights for a variety of payloads.
